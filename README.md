# Harmony Chat

This is a voice chat web-app that uses spatial audio to allow cross-over audio between channels.

Frameworks:

- Next.js (React)
- Socket.io for client/server communication
- WebRTC for Audio (signalled by socket.io)
- Web Audio API to spatialize the sound on clients
- Material UI for some basic component building blocks
